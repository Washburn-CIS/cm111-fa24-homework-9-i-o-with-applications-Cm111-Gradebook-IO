# Grade Book Project

This project will produce a text-based grade book application.

You will need to meet 6 checkpoints for this project before you can develop your final solution. When you complete a checkpoint, make a commit with the comment "Checkpoint #N Complete" where N is the checkpoint number. Checkpoints will be graded on a pass/fail basis (with a late-pass as a possibility) and you must pass a checkpoint in order to receive unit tests and instructions for the next checkpoint. You may not work ahead on checkpoint requirements beyond the checkpoint you are currently working on and doing so will result in not passing your current checkpoint. Grading comments will be left on the most recent commit by the deadline. Not passing a checkpoint means you will need to make another commit correcting your mistakes from the prior grading comments before you can proceed to the next checkpoint. Checkpoints will be graded following Tuesday and Friday commits and a maximum of two checkpoints a week may be passed. When a checkpoint is passed, make sure to perform a pull to receive the newest unit tests and instructions. Checkpoints that are not passed before the final due date will not receive credit (again, you must pass through them sequentially without working ahead of your current checkpoint and you may only pass through a maximum of two a week). Don't alter any file other than Student.java and GradeBook.java. 

Here are the checkpoint due dates for the project and very brief descriptions of the tasks:

1. Static Method for Exam Average: (early: on or before 6pm 3/19, late: after 6pm 3/26)
2. Tracking Exams with Arrays: (early: on or before 6pm 3/26, late: after 6pm 4/2)
3. Basic POJOs for Student Records: (early: on or before 6pm 4/2, late: after 6pm 4/9)
4. Grade Entry: (early: on or before 6pm 4/9, late: after 6pm 4/16)
5. Import/Export Student Data: (early: on or before 6pm 4/16, late: after 6pm 4/23)
6. Load/Save Files: (early: on or before 6pm 4/23, late: after 6pm 4/30)

Checkpoints will not be graded after 5/7 and your last commit on this date will be used for the purposes of determining the final project grade. Additional instructions for your final commit will be posted after you pass checkpoint #6.


## Checkpoint #1 Instructions

Your first task is to complete the implementation of the getExamAverage method in Student.java. A method header has already been included for you. Look at the javadoc comment at the top of the method and implement the method as this comment instructs you to. Check the unit tests for additional guidance. 

**Due dates: early on or before 6pm 3/19, late after 6pm 3/26, no credit after 6PM on 5/7**
